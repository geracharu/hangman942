# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Introduction

This project aims to enhance fundamental Python programming skills by completing a series of tasks related to lists, user input, random number generation,user input validation, loop control, and function usage to create a simple guessing game.

## Project Overview

The program prompts the user to guess a letter, continuously asking until they enter a valid alphabetical character. Once a valid guess is entered, it checks if the letter is present in a secret word and provides feedback accordingly.

## Project Objectives

- Gain proficiency in creating and manipulating lists
- Understand the concept of user input and how to handle it in Python
- Utilize the random module to generate random numbers and perform random selections

## Project Tasks

1. Continuously ask the user to enter a single letter
2. Validate user input to ensure it's a single alphabetical character
3. Check if the guessed letter exists in the secret word
4. Provide feedback based on the guess
5. Use functions to organize code and improve readability

## Installation Instructions

1. Install Python 3.x or higher
2. Ensure the Python environment is properly set up

## Usage Instructions

1. Execute the 'milestone_2.py' file using the Python command line
2. Execute the 'milestone_3.py' file using the Python command line

## File Structure

- milestone_3.py: The main Python script containing the game logic

## Introduction

This project builds upon the previous milestones by creating a simple hangman game. The player is presented with an underscore-filled representation of a secret word and must guess letters to uncover the word. Each incorrect guess results in a decrease in the player's lives, and the game ends when either all letters are guessed correctly or the player runs out of lives.

## Project Overview

This project enhances the user's understanding of control flow, user input validation, and object-oriented programming concepts. By implementing the hangman game mechanics, the user gains hands-on experience with handling user interactions, managing game states, and utilizing various programming techniques.

## Project Objectives

- Reinforce user input validation skills
- Implement control flow mechanisms for game logic
- Practice object-oriented programming concepts

## Project Tasks

1. Create a class named Hangman to represent the game
2. Define methods for initializing the game, checking guesses, updating game status, and playing the game
3. Implement user input validation to ensure valid guesses
4. Utilize control flow statements to manage the game progression
5. Handle incorrect guesses and decrement player's lives
6. Display game status information throughout the game
7. Check for victory or loss conditions

## Installation Instructions

1. Ensure Python 3.x or higher is installed
2. Verify the Python environment is properly configured

## Usage Instructions

1. Execute the 'milestone_4.py' file using the Python command line

## File Structure

- milestone_4.py: The main Python script containing the hangman game implementation

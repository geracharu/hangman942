## Introduction

This project aims to enhance fundamental Python programming skills by completing a series of tasks related to lists, user input, random number generation,user input validation, loop control, and function usage to create a simple guessing game.

## Project Overview

The program prompts the user to guess a letter, continuously asking until they enter a valid alphabetical character. Once a valid guess is entered, it checks if the letter is present in a secret word and provides feedback accordingly.

## Project Objectives

- Gain proficiency in creating and manipulating lists
- Understand the concept of user input and how to handle it in Python
- Utilize the random module to generate random numbers and perform random selections

## Project Tasks

1. Continuously ask the user to enter a single letter
2. Validate user input to ensure it's a single alphabetical character
3. Check if the guessed letter exists in the secret word
4. Provide feedback based on the guess
5. Use functions to organize code and improve readability

## Installation Instructions

1. Install Python 3.x or higher
2. Ensure the Python environment is properly set up

## Usage Instructions

1. Execute the 'milestone_2.py' file using the Python command line
2. Execute the 'milestone_3.py' file using the Python command line

## File Structure

- milestone_3.py: The main Python script containing the game logic
